=== CLAUDE USER MANUAL REMINDER ===

BEFORE proceeding, ensure you have read and understood:
  /d/prod/simple_code/CLAUDE_USER_MANUAL.md

This manual contains:
- How to determine SCALE and SCOPE of work
- The 6 lifecycle stages and when to apply them
- Mandatory rules for project confinement
- Complete command reference
- Common mistakes to avoid

If you haven't read it, STOP and read it now.
If you have read it, proceed with the work below.

=====================================

=== SCALE AND SCOPE AWARENESS ===

FIRST: Determine the SCALE and SCOPE of the request.

SCALE (what level are you working at?):
  - SYSTEM:   New project/library (requires FULL structure below)
  - SUBSYSTEM: New module within existing project (partial structure)
  - CLUSTER:  Group of related classes (src/ changes only)
  - CLASS:    Single class (src/ file only)
  - FEATURE:  Single feature in existing class (edit only)

SCOPE (what dev-ops stages are needed?):
  For SYSTEM scale â ALL stages (1-6)
  For SUBSYSTEM scale â Stages 2-5 (skip skeleton if exists)
  For CLUSTER scale â Stages 2-3, maybe 5
  For CLASS scale â Stage 2, maybe 3
  For FEATURE scale â Stage 2 only (edit existing file)

=== SIMPLE_* PROJECT STRUCTURE (FOR SYSTEM SCALE) ===

NEW projects MUST have this complete structure:

PROJECT_ROOT/
âââ project_name.ecf        # ECF configuration with library AND test targets
âââ README.md               # Project description, usage, examples
âââ CHANGELOG.md            # Version history
âââ .gitignore              # Git ignore patterns
âââ src/                    # Source code
â   âââ main_class.e
â   âââ supporting_classes.e
âââ testing/                # Test classes
â   âââ test_app.e          # Test runner (root class for test target)
â   âââ lib_tests.e         # Test cases inheriting TEST_SET_BASE
âââ docs/                   # Documentation
â   âââ index.html          # Main documentation page
â   âââ api/                # API documentation (optional)
âââ bin/                    # Compiled binaries (deployed)
â   âââ project_name.exe
âââ inno/                   # Installer files (optional)
    âââ project_name.iss    # INNO Setup script
    âââ Output/             # Built installer

=== LIFECYCLE STAGES ===

You MUST complete ALL stages in order:

STAGE 1: PROJECT SKELETON
- Create directory structure (src/, testing/, docs/, bin/)
- Create ECF with both library and test targets
- Create README.md with project description
- Create CHANGELOG.md with initial version
- Create .gitignore

STAGE 2: CODE GENERATION
- Generate main classes in src/
- Apply DBC, void safety, SCOOP patterns
- Validate with simple_codegen validator

STAGE 3: TEST CREATION
- Create test_app.e (test runner root class)
- Create lib_tests.e (test cases)
- ECF test target must include testing cluster
- Use simple_testing library

STAGE 4: DOCUMENTATION
- Create docs/index.html with:
  - Project overview
  - API reference
  - Usage examples
  - Installation instructions

STAGE 5: BUILD AND DEPLOY
- Compile with test target, run tests
- Compile release target (finalized)
- Copy binary to bin/ folder
- Deploy to /d/prod/bin/ if ecosystem tool

STAGE 6: INSTALLER (optional for CLI tools)
- Create INNO Setup script
- Build installer
- Test installation/uninstallation

=== CLI COMMANDS FOR EACH STAGE ===

Stage 1: simple_codegen init --session <name>
Stage 2: simple_codegen generate --session <name>
Stage 3: simple_codegen generate-tests --session <name>
Stage 4: simple_codegen docs --session <name>
Stage 5: simple_codegen compile --session <name> --project <path>
Stage 6: simple_codegen inno --session <name>

=== VERIFICATION CHECKLIST ===

Before declaring project COMPLETE:
[ ] ECF has both main AND test targets
[ ] testing/ folder exists with test_app.e and lib_tests.e
[ ] docs/ folder exists with index.html
[ ] README.md exists with project description
[ ] CHANGELOG.md exists with version history
[ ] .gitignore exists
[ ] bin/ folder exists with compiled binary
[ ] All tests pass
[ ] Documentation is complete

=== PROJECT CONFINEMENT (CRITICAL) ===
ALL work MUST be confined to the project directory.

1. FILE CREATION:
   - ONLY create files inside the project directory
   - NEVER create files in parent directories (e.g., /d/prod/)
   - All source files go in project_root/src/
   - All generated files stay in project_root/

2. COMPILATION - USE CLI TOOLS (NOT ec.exe/ec.sh directly):
   *** NEVER run ec.exe or ec.sh directly ***
   *** USE these CLI tools instead: ***

   For session-based projects:
     simple_codegen.exe compile --session <name> --project <path>

   For any Eiffel project:
     simple_codegen compile --session <name> --project <path>
     (compiles from correct directory, handles errors)

   These tools:
   - Automatically run from correct directory
   - Create EIFGENs in proper location
   - Handle refinement prompts on errors
   - Track compilation history

3. ARTIFACTS:
   - Logs, temp files, output â project_root/
   - Test results â project_root/
   - EIFGENs â project_root/EIFGENs/
   - Documentation â project_root/docs/

4. VERIFICATION:
   Before ANY file operation, verify the path is INSIDE project_root.
   Pattern: path.has_substring(project_root)

VIOLATION of these rules causes:
- EIFGENs in wrong location (locks files elsewhere)
- Pollution of shared directories
- Confusion about what belongs to which project

I need you to design an Eiffel system based on my requirements.

=== YOUR TASK ===
1. Analyze my requirements
2. Decompose into cohesive Eiffel classes
3. Output a structured specification in JSON format

=== REQUIREMENTS ===
[USER: Replace this section with your system requirements]
Example: "I need a library management system with book tracking, member management, and loan processing"

=== DESIGN PRINCIPLES (Simple Eiffel Ecosystem) ===
1. DESIGN BY CONTRACT (DBC):
   - Write contracts BEFORE implementation (Specification Hat)
   - Preconditions: what callers must guarantee
   - Postconditions: what feature guarantees (must be COMPLETE, not just true)
   - Class invariants: what's always true about objects

2. VOID SAFETY:
   - 'attached' for required references
   - 'detachable' for optional references
   - Pattern: if attached x as l_x then ... end

3. COMMAND-QUERY SEPARATION (CQS):
   - Commands modify state, return nothing
   - Queries return values, no side effects

4. NAMING CONVENTIONS:
   - Class: ALL_CAPS (LIBRARY_BOOK)
   - Feature: lower_snake_case (find_by_title)
   - Arguments: a_ prefix (a_name, a_count)
   - Locals: l_ prefix (l_result, l_file)
   - Booleans: is_/has_/can_ prefix (is_empty, has_key)

5. SINGLE RESPONSIBILITY:
   - Each class has one clear purpose
   - Complex internals, simple external interface

=== OUTPUT FORMAT ===
Respond with a JSON object containing the system specification:

```json
{
  "type": "system_spec",
  "system_name": "library_system",
  "description": "Library management system for tracking books and loans",
  "classes": [
    {
      "name": "LIBRARY_BOOK",
      "description": "Represents a book in the library catalog",
      "attributes": [
        {"name": "title", "type": "STRING", "description": "Book title"},
        {"name": "author", "type": "STRING", "description": "Author name"},
        {"name": "is_available", "type": "BOOLEAN", "description": "Availability status"}
      ],
      "features": [
        {"name": "check_out", "type": "command", "description": "Mark book as borrowed"},
        {"name": "return_book", "type": "command", "description": "Mark book as available"}
      ],
      "invariants": ["title not empty", "author not empty"]
    }
  ],
  "relationships": [
    {"from": "LIBRARY_CATALOG", "to": "LIBRARY_BOOK", "type": "contains"}
  ]
}
```

Output ONLY the JSON. No explanations before or after.

=== NEXT CLI COMMAND ===
Save this JSON response to a file and run:
  simple_codegen process --session <SESSION> --input <response_file.json>

This parses your system specification and generates the first class prompt.
The CLI will guide you through generating each class in sequence.
